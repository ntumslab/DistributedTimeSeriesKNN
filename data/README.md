# Datasets

## Data File Format

One time series per line.

* The first value in a line is the class of a time series (not used in our work).
* Then there exist T values representing a time series of length T.


## Synthetic Dataset

### Generation

This dataset consists of 12500 time series of length 12500 each, following the format in the UCR Time Series datasets.

Each data point is generated by a simple stochastic process. That is,

```
d_{i} = d_{i-1} + x 
d_{1} = x
where x ~ Normal(mean = 0, variance = 1)
```

For each dataset, we concatenate training data and test data to obtain larger kNN search space.
