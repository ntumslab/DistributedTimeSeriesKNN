# Datasets

## Data File Format

Our experimented data files follow the format of UCR datasets.

One time series of length T per line:

```
time_series_class data_point_1 data_point_2 ... data_point_T
```

Our work does not use the first value that represents the class label of time series.

## Synthetic Dataset

### Generation

This dataset consists of 12500 time series of length 12500 each, following the format in the UCR Time Series datasets.

Each data point is generated by a simple stochastic process. That is,

```
d_{i} = d_{i-1} + x 
d_{1} = x
where x ~ Normal(mean = 0, variance = 1)
```

## UCR Time Series Datasets

The real-world datasets can be downloaded in the following website:

```

For each dataset, we concatenate training data and test data to obtain larger kNN search space.
